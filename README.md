Sends screen color to RGB light bulbs.

_Currently only supports LIFX RGB light bulbs._


## Usage

Copy the .exe file as well as the sample StartScreenColors.bat file to a directory on your computer.

Modify the .bat file to point to the path you just copied the files to.

Edit the .bat file as needed. The defaults should work in most cases.

#### LaunchBox

If running this on a system with LaunchBox/BigBox you can add the .bat file as a startup program in LaunchBox.

Enjoy!
